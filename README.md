# The Login Game

They said signing up would be easy.

**It's not.**

## 🌀 What's This?

The Login Game is a satirical web experience that puts you through the most absurd, bureaucratic, and soul-crushing account creation process ever imagined.  
CAPTCHAs? Yes. Username nightmares? Naturally. An age restriction that only allows _18-year-olds exactly_? You bet.

If you've ever screamed at a broken login portal or wept over expired verification links, this is your therapy.

## 🧠 What You'll Face

- Infinite Terms & Conditions
- CAPTCHA loops that test your humanity _and_ your patience
- Passwords that _seem_ simple
- Security questions you couldn’t answer if your life depended on it (and it does)
- And more!

## 🏆 Can You Make an Account?

Most people can't, so don't get your hopes up.
Or do. It doesn't really matter.
