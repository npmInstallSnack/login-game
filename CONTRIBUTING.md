# Contributing to The Login Game

Thanks for your interest in making The Login Game even more absurd!

## How Can I Help?

- **Suggest new levels:** Got an idea for a ridiculous signup step? Open an issue or submit a PR!
- **Improve UI/UX:** Pixel-perfect tweaks, accessibility fixes, or retro design improvements are welcome.
- **Bug fixes:** If you spot a bug, let us know or submit a fix.
- **Refactor code:** Clean up HTML, CSS, or JavaScript for clarity and maintainability.
- **Localization:** Want to translate the game’s pain into another language? Go for it.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repo** and clone your fork.
2. Install any dependencies (if needed).
3. Make your changes in a new branch.
4. Test your changes locally. (I recommend [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VS Code.)
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description.

## Guidelines

- If your idea is a large change (e.g., new level), open a new issue to discuss it before making a PR.
- Keep the tone satirical and fun.
- All new levels should be as unnecessarily complex (but not too much) as possible.
- Use clear, readable code and comments.
- Follow the [MIT License](LICENSE).
- Respect others—no hate, spam, or offensive content. For more, read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Issues & Feedback

- Open an issue for bugs, feature requests, or ideas.
- For questions, use Discussions or Issues.

## Code Style

- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting.
- Stick to HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Talk in an issue if you want to use an external library or language.

## Accreditation

If you make a PR and it's merged, you'll be added to the [credits](credits.html)! If you wish to stay anonymous or use another name in the credits, just reach out. Credits are formatted like this:
